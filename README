Base project for python+opengl+gtk application

It contains empty gladeui, and empty gl scene. There is support for camera movement and farme dt calculation to ease making simulations. Project includes also simple shadres library and third-party library for matrix transformations. Should work fine on windows but was develop fully under linux.
